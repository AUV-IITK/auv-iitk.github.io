                        controlling the robot and making it autonomous. We use latest cutting edge 
                        technologies in the world of robotics software. We use ROS(Robot Operating System) 
                        as a communication middleware between all processes running on our robot.The software 
                        stack of Anahita consists of dedicated layers for the hardware integration, 
                        controls and navigation, motion planning, perception and acoustic localization. 
                        The software subsytem carries out simulations Gazebo and UWSim to ensure  that 
                        things work smoothly before actual testing.The main aim of software subsystem is 
                        to write code, that is generic and error free, in order efficiently coordinate the
                         vehicles motion and enable it perform at full potential. </p>

                        powering our AUV. We work on the electrical aspects of the AUV, providing
                        power, driving actuators and interfacing with various sensors on board. We 
                        build custom made PCBs to meet the specific requirements of the tasks. The
                         Electrical framework consists of Power Distribution System and the Monitoring 
                         system. Arduino Mega is used to control the actuation and read
                        data from various sensors which in turn is controlled by an Intel NUC. 
                        The main aim of the Electrical subsystem is to manage electrical setup and 
                        act as an interface between the software and mechanical subsystems. </p>

                        and test the physical structure of the AUV and then manufacture it
                        using state of art manufacturing techniques. We use latest software such as SolidWorks and ANSYS 
                        to make the design robust, modular, light and strong. </p>

                        We represent the team before our sponsors and try to procure them. 
                        We maintain the team website and pages on the different social media platforms. 
                        The main aim of the business subsystem is to ensure that the team gets sufficient

One of the main challenges in the frame design was to reduce the mass without compromising the structural rigidity. Unlike our previous vehicle, VARUN, the frame is wired with truss structures to provide structural support without reducing the mass. After completing the initial design, ANSYS Topology optimization was used to reduce the mass. A total reduction of 80% in mass was achieved using this method. The frame is manufactured using Abrasive Water-jet Machining using 6061-T6 Alloy. Aluminium sheets of two different thickness: 5mm thick sheets for side plates and 4mm thick sheets for the rest of the frame are used for the frame design. The significant advantage of such a frame design is that all the components are attached directly to the frame, eliminating the need for separate mounts for individual parts. In addition, the design reduces weight, complexity and allows for efficient use of space. All components are placed such that the centre of mass is at the relative centre, ensuring directional stability and ease of control.",

Li-Po batteries are chosen not only for their high energy density but also an outstanding balance between other features such as high discharge rate, low self-discharge rate, and good cycle life. In addition, various components in the vehicle require input power at different voltages for their functioning. The 22.2V supply is distributed into 5V, 12V and 19V regulated rails using buck converters (LM25085 from Texas Instruments). An unregulated rail created from the batteries powers the thrusters. The current and voltage across each rail of the Power Distribution System are monitored. The current is monitored by Hall effect current sensors (ACS725 from Allegro Microsystems). Voltage is monitored by first using a voltage divider to convert the rail voltage into a value in the 0-5V range and then reading the value using the built-in ADC in the Arduino. Arduino Mega is used for controlling the actuation and reading data from various sensors, which in turn is controlled by an Intel NUC. The vehicle has two kill switches to terminate the mission in need of faults or to use it as a switch. One switch is the Hard Kill switch which completely shuts down the vehicle. The other soft kill switch stops the power to all the processes except the power to the Onboard computer.",

The output from the low-pass filter is re-amplified in order to map the output of the filter into the input range of ADC for maximum efficiency. The signal is then converted into the differential form in order to send it to the ADC (LTC2383). The signal from the ADC is sent to an all programmable SoC development board from MicroZed, which converts it into a single-ended signal and then transfers it into the processor's memory.

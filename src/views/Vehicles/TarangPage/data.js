            "content": "A major improvement over our previous AUV's is the design of a single main hull. The vehicle hull is made of carbon fibre, making it easier to mold into the desired shape and reducing weight. The weight reduction is advantageous as it significantly minimizes the thrust to move or stop the bot. In addition, a single hull allows us to increase the simplicity of design to a large extent, reducing the need for penetrators in and out of individual hulls and improving accessibility. The penetrators were often the primary cause for most of the leakages in our previous bot, and it was challenging for us to find and fix leaks. A single hull allows us to check for leakages using a single test without being in the pool. We have installed a pressure sensor in the main hull, which assists in leak detection. We lower the pressure inside the hull slightly once all the components are fitted in it. If the pressure sensor reading increases with time, i.e. air can enter due to some leaks in the hull, we will know about the leakages even before putting the vehicle in water.",

A reduction in weight and thrust requirements due to a light carbon fiber hull has enabled us to reduce the number of thrusters from 8 to 6. It reduced the cost and maintenance required for the propellers. We performed vehicle motion simulations in a simulation environment in gazebo and ensured no excess load (RPM) is put on thrusters due to their lower number, even at comparable speeds as the last vehicle. We also verified that all 6 degrees of freedom are achievable by clever use of thrusters. The reduction in the number of thrusters simplified the vehicle dynamics and made thruster allocation simpler.",

The marker dropper is located near the camera to minimize the errors due to frame transformations. It consists of a star shaped obstructor preventing the marker (golf balls from falling). Once a trigger signal is received, the servo actuated star-shaped obstructor rotates and allows the markers to fall.",

            "content": "We have improved the control system in our new vehicle by performing fine thruster calibrations and using a cascaded PID controller for precise movements. Tarang is fully actuated with six thrusters providing six degrees of freedom to the vehicle. Each thruster is calibrated to map the thrust vs PWM input pulse, and these mappings are used to generate a thruster allocation matrix to distribute the thrusts generated by the PID controller to the thrusters. Since each thruster provides thrust only in a particular degree of freedom, it gives a highly decoupled system that allows the vehicle to perform aggressive manoeuvres. Furthermore, decoupled thrusters with the independent position and velocity controller provide a way to tune the position and orientation controller independently. Hence we can tune the PID systems easily.We have implemented a cascaded PID controller for better motion tracking, which considers the error in velocity as well as the error in position to calculate thrusts. It allows a faster compensation with the velocity controller providing a mechanism to prevent overshoot. Since the vehicle's weight is less, it can provide faster response, but it is also prone to large overshoots and oscillations, so parameters are tuned to provide damping and slow down the response. As a result, the motion tracking of Tarang is better than our last vehicle Anahita in terms of lower settling time, almost zero overshoot and ability to perform aggressive manoeuvres.",

This year we have added an implementation of the SLAM algorithm known as FastSLAM for navigation. Fast SLAM provides a factored and more efficient way to solve the SLAM problem and provides a way to solve it with a complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks observed. The navigation layer publishes a world map estimate using a 2.5-dimensional occupancy grid. The occupancy grid stores the estimates of the current state of the robot, global locations of the landmarks and previously traversed locations on the map. The global map helps us in planning and changing our strategy dynamically.",

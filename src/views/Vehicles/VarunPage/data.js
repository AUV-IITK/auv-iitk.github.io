    "brief" : "VARUN' was the first Autonomous Underwater Vehicle developed by Team AUV-IITK. Varun participated in several competitions like NIOT SAVe. The vehicle consisted of a central pressure hull along with separate enclosures for the sensors and pneumatic valves. Varun had been equipped with two cameras to provide it with vision, an Inertial Measurement Unit for navigation and orientation, and a depth sensor to enable it to conquer greater depths. Varun could drop markers and fire torpedoes underwater.",

This high pressurized gas being supplied to the various outlets at 100 psi, using a regulator valve on the tank. Supply consists of feed lines used only to transport air throughout the system and the various valves specific to each task. Solenoid valves are being used as they are easy to manipulate using signals sent from the micro-controller. Janatics 5/2 double-acting solenoid valve is used for the marker dropper while 2/2 double-acting solenoid valve is used to shoot torpedo.Two Janatics double-acting pneumatic cylinders are used for the dropper mechanism. The torpedoes are channelized through acrylic tube passage using pressurized air. Each torpedo is manufactured using the in-house available 3-D printer. The material used in manufacturing is polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable thermoplastic.

Voltage is monitored by first using a voltage divider to convert the rail voltage into a value in the 0-5V range and then reading the value using the built-in ADC in the Arduino. Arduino Mega is used for controlling the actuation and reading data from various sensors, which in turn is controlled by an Intel NUC.

The current and voltage across each rail of the Power Distribution System are monitored. The current is monitored by Hall effect current sensors (ACS725 from Allegro Microsystems). Voltage is monitored by first using a voltage divider to convert the rail voltage into a value in the 0-5V range and then reading the value using the built-in ADC in the Arduino. Arduino Mega is used for controlling the actuation and reading data from various sensors, which in turn is controlled by an Intel NUC.
